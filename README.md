# **Group Project Design Group 1**

## **About the Application**  
Our application is a streamlined group project management website for users to easily manage their college group projects. It allows users to manage their groups in one location, organising how they will complete their work so that they can deliver high-quality grouo projects on time.

## **Key Features**  
The key features of our application were designed to enhance the user expereince:
  1. Users can create an account, verify their email and then log in to this account to promote security amongst users when creating accounts.
  2. Users can create projects and add other members to these projects who will be prompted to join the group via an email link.
  3. Users can add their free time for group meetings, view the available times of other members and find a time that all users are available for a meeting.
  4. Users can create tasks and assign members to these tasks and view them on their home page and project page.
  5. Users can create subteams and use these as a member to assign tasks to.

# **Step by Step**  

## **Live Deployment**  
- **Frontend:** Available atüîó [GroupGrade Frontend](https://groupgrade.vercel.app/)  
- **Backend:** Hosted on **Heroku** at:  
  üîó [GroupGrade Backend](https://group-grade-backend-5f919d63857a.herokuapp.com/)  

## **Testing the Application**  
You can test the application's functionalities in two ways:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Using the Live Deployment**  
- Visit the deployed frontend (Some functionality might not work).  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Running Locally (Recommended)**  

If you prefer to run and test the application (both frontend and backend) on your local machine, follow the **Installation Guide** below.  

- **Note:** If you run the frontend locally, it will make API calls to the **backend running on your local host**.  
- However, if you want the local frontend to make calls to the **deployed backend**, follow these steps:  

1. Navigate to the following file in the repository:  
<path-to-repository-directory>\Group1ProjectDesign\frontend\src\App.jsx

2. **Modify the `axios.defaults.baseURL` setting:**  
- **Uncomment** the following line:  
  ```javascript
  axios.defaults.baseURL = "https://group-grade-backend-5f919d63857a.herokuapp.com";
  ```
- **Comment out** the following line:  
  ```javascript
  axios.defaults.baseURL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000";
  ```

This change will ensure that the local frontend makes API calls to the **deployed backend** instead of your local backend.
